## ðŸ›  UI Guidelines
- Use **[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/)** for buttons, modals, inputs, navigation, and other UI components.  
- Tailwind CSS for layout & utilities.  
- Always prefer shadcn components for new UI to maintain consistency.

## âš¡ State & API
- Use **Redux slices** for all state management.  
- API calls must go through `axiosInstance` located in `src/config/axios.js`.  
- Keep components clean â†’ all async logic stays in slices or services.

## ðŸ“‚ Notes
- Follow the folder structure for maintainability and scalability.  
- Keep the UI consistent with the dark theme and accessibility in mind.
